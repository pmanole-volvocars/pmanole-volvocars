## Hi there, I'm Paul ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer consultant from Thoughtworks. This is my Volvo Cars ðŸš™ account.

### A little bit about me

I focus on fullstack cloud web applications, and I have worked primarily with .NET, SQL, Node, TypeScript and React, practicing XP, TDD, BDD, DDD, and more.

I'm a functional programming nerd and I like to incorporate functional programming principles in all code I write, regardless of language.

Some of my favorite technologies are:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Effect-TS](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect)
- [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
- [OCaml](https://ocaml.org)
- [Gleam](https://gleam.run/)
